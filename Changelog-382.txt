Asuswrt-Merlin 382 Changelog
============================

382.1 Beta (xx-xxx-2017)
   - NOTE: For brievity:
           AM380 = Asuswrt-Merlin 380.xxx
           AM382 = Asuswrt-Merlin 382.xxx
           Asus382 = Asus's GPL 3.0.0.4.382_xxx
           For now only the RT-AC86U is supported by AM382.  Other
           models will gradually be moved to AM382 as Asus upgrades
           them to the 382 code base.

   - NEW: Re-started from a clean Asus382_15098 GPL.  The code from AM380.68
          was adapted and merged on top of it.  This means that old bugs might be
          gone, but also new ones might be present in this release.

          Highlights of the changes between Asus380 and Asus382:
            - New Trend Micro DPI engine, with two-way IPS
            - New networkmap service (now closed source)
            - New OpenVPN implementation (now closed source)
            - Numerous security enhancements throughout the code

          This changelog will focus on changes that happened between AM380.68 and
          AM382.1, or between Asus382_15098 and AM382.

   - NEW: Added support for the RT-AC86U and its Broadcom HND 5.02 platform
   - NEW: Added support for inline CRLs when importing an ovpn file
   - NEW: Added support for fullcone NAT (RT-AC86U)
   - CHANGED: Since Asus has now closed their OpenVPN source code, that
              closed code was replaced with new code based om our
              original implementation from AM380.  From now on, AM382's
              OpenVPN development will be separate from Asus' own.
   - CHANGED: SSH host keys are now stored in /jffs/ssl/ rather than nvram.
   - CHANGED: SMB2 is enabled by default on RT-AC86U (no performance penalty
              on that platform)
