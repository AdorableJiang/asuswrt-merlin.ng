Asuswrt-Merlin 382 Changelog
============================

382.1 Beta (xx-xxx-2017)
    Asuswrt-Merlin 382 was rebuilt from a clean 3.0.0.4.382_15098
    GPL archive, as merging the new 382 codebase on top of the existing
    one was proving too difficult.  This means some new issues might
    have been introduced, while other existing ones might have
    been fixed.

    For simplicity, the following abbreviations are used below:
       AM380 = Asuswrt-Merlin 380.xxx
       AM382 = Asuswrt-Merlin 382.xxx
       Asus380 = Asus's previous GPL 3.0.0.4.380_xxxx
       Asus382 = Asus's GPL 3.0.0.4.382_xxxx

   AM382.1 is based on AM380.68_2.

   At this time, only the RT-AC86U is supported by AM382.  Other
   models will gradually be moved to AM382 as Asus upgrades
   them to the new 382 code base.

   Also note that since Asus' OpenVPN code is now closed source
   starting with Asus382, it was decided to fork away from their
   OpenVPN code, so we can retain our existing features, and
   continue to further develop the OpenVPN support.  This means
   that a lot of the OpeNVPN code had to be rewritten or modified
   to work within the new 382 codebase.


   This changelog will focus on changes that happened between
    AM380.68 and AM382.1, or between Asus382_15098 and AM382.

   - NEW: Moved to Asus382 codebase.  Some of the most important
          changes between Asus380 and Asus382:
            - New Trend Micro DPI engine, with two-way IPS
            - New networkmap service (now closed source)
            - New OpenVPN implementation (now closed source,
              not used by AM382)
            - Numerous security enhancements throughout the code

   - NEW: Merged with GPL 382_16466 (RT-AC86U).
   - NEW: Added support for the RT-AC86U and its Broadcom HND platform.
          Note that IPTraffic is not supported by this model due to
          its newer Linux kernel.
   - NEW: Added support for inline CRLs when importing an ovpn file
   - NEW: Added support for fullcone NAT (RT-AC86U)
   - NEW: Added WiFi Radar (Broadcom's Visualization app) in the
          Wireless section (RT-AC86U)
   - NEW: Added option to disable the Asus NAT tunnel service under
          Other Settings -> Tweak.  Not quite sure what this
          partly closed source service is for, but it eats a
          fair amount of CPU and RAM.
   - NEW: Webui options on OpenVPN Server page to quickly choose
          between pushing LAN or LAN + Internet access (ported
          from Asus382)
   - NEW: Option to select the bitsize to use (1024 or 2048) when
          automatically generating the OpenVPN server key/certs
          (ported from Asus382)
   - CHANGED: SSH host keys are now stored in /jffs/ssl/ rather
              than nvram.
   - CHANGED: SMB2 is enabled by default on RT-AC86U (no performance
              penalty on that platform)
   - CHANGED: Moved UPnP Secure Mode setting from the Tweaks section
              to the WAN page, next to other UPnP settings.
   - CHANGED: Moved "Modify key and certs" link to its own dedicated
              row and made it a button for improved visibility
              (OpenVPN client & server pages)
   - FIXED: Some LAN clients couldn't be added to the TOR redirected
            client list.
   - REMOVED: Obsolete/exotic HMAC digests for OpenVPN servers (to
              match with Asus' own supported list)
   - REMOVED: "Custom" OpenVPN authentication mode (which probably
              nobody used or even understood).
